# SilentPlate
Interactive restaurant review application


## âœ… Objective

To build a mobile-first application that allows users to:

Discover restaurants via an interactive map

View AI-generated summaries of public reviews

Leave private feedback for restaurants (buffered before going public)

(Optional future features) Participate in loyalty programs, access restaurant profiles, and more

App will be built using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) for shared logic, with SwiftUI for iOS and Kotlin for Android frontends.

### ðŸ“… Phase 0: Project Planning

#### 1. Define Core Features (MVP):

Interactive Map with restaurants nearby appearing

Clicking pin a restaurant should allow user to view the restaurant profile with an AI summary of all reviews from different platformsÂ 



#### 2. Define Non-MVP (Post-launch):

Loyalty/rewards integration

Public review feeds

Chat with restaurant

Points redemption system

#### 3. Define Personas:

Primary: App Users / Diners

Secondary: Restaurant Owners / Managers (future onboarding)

### ðŸš€ Phase 1: Technical Setup

#### 1. Initialize Git Repository

Set up GitHub / GitLab with dev/staging/main branches

#### 2. KMM Project Setup

Create a KMM base project

Define shared module for business logic, networking, models

iOS: Integrate KMM via Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods

Android: Integrate shared module via standard Gradle setup

#### 3. Dependency Planning

Ktor (networking)

SQLDelight or Realm (offline/local storage)

Koin / Kodein (DI)

Jetpack Compose (Android UI)

SwiftUI (iOS UI)

Google Maps SDK (Android)

MapKit (iOS)

### ðŸ”§ Phase 2: Core Feature Development

#### 1. Onboarding Flow

Display retro-styled welcome screen

Explain app value proposition ("Find & review with AI")

Get location permission

#### 2. Map Screen

Display userâ€™s location

Show nearby restaurants as pins (using Google Places API or similar)

Tap on pin to open Restaurant Profile

#### 3. Restaurant Profile Screen

Show name, location, cuisine, photos

Display AI-generated review summary (generated from scraped reviews)

Call to Action: "Leave Private Feedback"

#### 4. Feedback UI

Short form: thumbs up/down, optional text

Feedback submitted privately to system (simulated initially)

Placeholder for review buffer feature

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Testing & QA

Manual QA:

Test UI on both Android and iOS

Location permission flows

Restaurant pin accuracy

Offline behavior (if any local storage)

Automated:

Unit tests for shared logic (KMM)

Snapshot tests for iOS UI

Instrumented tests for Android

### ðŸ“Š Phase 4: Launch Prep

1. App Store Setup:

Create App Store & Play Console entries

Prepare assets: icons, screenshots, description

2. Analytics & Crash Reporting:

Firebase / Sentry / Mixpanel setup

3. Marketing Page (Optional):

Static landing page explaining app purpose and collecting emails

### ðŸŽ‰ Post-Launch Plan

1. Gather User Feedback

Feedback loop inside app ("What would you improve?")

Track top-used features and drop-offs

2. Prioritize Phase 2 Features

Loyalty program

Public review aggregation

User accounts and history

3. Explore Monetization

Freemium model

Premium features (saved favorites, advanced filtering, loyalty perks)

####  Restaurant-facing dashboard (B2B model)

####  This document will evolve as the project progresses. Each section will be expanded with code architecture, wireframes, and task breakdowns as needed.
